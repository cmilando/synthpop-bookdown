Standard error will be approximated \\[ SE = \\sqrt(\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027 \\] You can also use math in footnotes like this1. We will approximate standard error to 0.0272 where we mention \\(p = \\frac{a}{b}\\)↩︎ \\(p\\) is unknown but expected to be around 1/3.
