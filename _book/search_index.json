[["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Synthetic population literature", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Synthetic population literature Community-Wide Health Risk Assessment Using Geographically Resolved Demographic Data: A Synthetic Population Approach (Levy, Fabian, &amp; Peters, 2014) Given insufficient geographic resolution in existing datasets on population demographics, this paper models a synthetic population approach using a cumulative risk assessment (which documents risks from multiple agents)(Levy, Fabian, and Peters 2014). Three major data inputs are used: ACS (American Community Survey) 5-year PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area) (Individual Data) ACS 5-year Census Tract Data (Constraints) BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) (Individual Data) The ACS data inputs are used in the development of the synthetic population, while the BRFSS data input is used for the application of the synthetic population to an epidemiological analysis of predictors of the outcome (in this paper, smoking behavior). The method of forming the synthetic population is simulated annealing with probabilistic reweighting: Select a random subset of households Compare the demographics of the random sample to the aggregate-level demographics distribution Replace individual households to see if the fit improves Application: CO software package (Williamson 2007) Key limitations: Underrepresentation of undocumented populations ACS microdata uses a very small subsample to represent the population of interest Community-Engaged Modeling of Geographic and Demographic Patterns of Multiple Public Health Risk Factors (Basra, Fabian, Holberger, French, and Levy, 2017) This second publication (Basra et al. 2017) uses the synthetic population created in the article published in 2014. BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) data was used to assess several outcomes: BMI, exercise, fruit and vegetable consumption, and diabetes prevalence. Regression models included: multivariable logistic regression for exercise, fruit and vegetable consumption, and diabetes prevalence; multivariable linear regression for BMI. Key limitations: ACS variables do not capture the full breadth of exposures predicting these outcomes Undocumented populations are excluded from census datasets Limitations of the BRFSS methodology Modeling the impact of exposure reductions using multi-stressor epidemiology, exposure models, and synthetic microdata: an application to birthweight in two environmental justice communities (Milando, Yitshak-Sade, Zanobetti, Levy, Laden, and Fabian, 2020) This third publication expands on the synthetic population methods and looks at changes in birthweight distribution as a result of simulated environmental changes (Milando et al. 2021). Key data inputs: ACS (American Community Survey) 5-year PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area) (Individual Data) ACS 5-year Census Tract Data (Constraints) MA Births State Data (Age, race-adjusted birth rates; probability distributions for gestational age, parity, smoking during pregnancy and goverment support) The method of forming the synthetic population is an expansion of the methods applied for the prior two papers, with two rounds of simulated annealing: Simulated annealing with replacement to create a synthetic population for Chelsea and Dorchester Simulated annealing without replacement, with probability sampling and logistic regression to create synthetic population of women giving birth In application of the generated synthetic population, this study applies probabilistic and regression modeling to predictions of newborn birthweight outcomes Used Monte Carlo to introduce uncertainty to predictions of sociobehavioral and clinical risk factors Application: CO software package (Williamson 2007) Key limitations: Same probability given to all possible birthdays Monte Carlo methods likely donâ€™t fully account for uncertainty Only looked at the census tract level, higher spatial resolution would improve simulation Challenge of assigning exposure directly rather than estimating via proxy variables References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
