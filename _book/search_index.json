Note that the geographic resolution used for these methods is the census tract level. Figure 4.1: Using PUMA and ACS to Generate a Synthetic Population OVERVIEW: Obtaining the datasets required: Creating lists of census tracts located in each of the 10 PUMAs using R Pulling ACS census tract data for each of the 10 PUMA sets of census tracts using R Pulling the Public Use Microdata Samples for each PUMA, including person and household variables The datasets are then cleaned: ACS dataset are cleaned and combined in R (with separate runs for each PUMA) PUMS data is cleaned and combined in R (with separate runs for each PUMA) N.B. (1) and (2) above generate output textfiles which can then be read into and implemented in the CO model, which is written in Fortran. Update a few additional tables: Constraining tables information textfile. This file is also an output file with parameters used to reflect different ancestry bins by PUMA. Control parameters file with PUMA name, number of constraint cells for that PUMA, and row below (number of constraint cells x 10). Run with CO_BU.exe, the executable created by compiling Fortran code. Read the resulting output from the CO work using R. 4.1 Geographic area There are 21 cities and towns included in the Mystic River Watershed area: Burlington Lexington Belmont Watertown Arlington Winchester Woburn Reading Stoneham Medford Somerville Cambridge Boston (East Boston, Charlestown) Everett Malden Melrose Wakefield Chelsea Revere Winthrop Wilmington 4.2 ACS constraint tables ACS 5-year (2021) detailed estimates tables for Massachusetts census tracts were obtained. 4.2.1 Race/Ethnicity B04006 People Reporting Ancestry Collapsed by town/city: all ancestry groups with more than 1% of the population represented are retained, those with less than 1% are collapsed to ‘other’ B03001 Hispanic or Latino by Specific Origin Note that ACS 5-year (2021) detailed estimates tables include People Reporting Single Ancestry, People Reporting Multiple Ancestry, and a combined table of both - People Reporting Ancestry (B04006, used here). In order to approximate the first-ancestry reported, as this is the ancestry included in the PUMS (see section below), we did some re-weighting of the B04006 table variables. In brief, this method was as follows: For a given PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area) in the set of 10 included PUMAs, and for each census tract within that PUMA, we re-weight all ancestry variables by proceeding across columns. If true total \\(= total_{true}\\) and total with multiple ancestries \\(= total_{obs}\\), and observed population in a given ancestry column for that row \\(= Z_{obs}\\), then the re-weighted \\(Z_{rw}\\) is \\[ Z_{rw} = k*Z_{obs} = {\\frac{total_{obs}}{total_{true}}}*Z_{obs} \\] To round to whole units of persons, we use a probabilistic coin-toss methodology: Let the probability of rounding up be \\(mod(Z_{rw},1)\\). Using the ‘set.seed()’ function in R, generate a random number, \\(P\\), between 0 and 1. Then, the rounded number is: \\[ Z_{rw-integer} = Z_{rw}-mod(Z_{rw},1)+P. \\] This is helpful, except when the new total, \\(total_{new}\\) no longer equals \\(total_{true}\\).To amend this, we apply a ‘fudge factor’: Rank all ancestry columns based on \\(Z_{rw_integer}\\). Based on the difference between \\(total_{true}\\) and \\(total_{new}\\), we adjust the data as needed: If \\(total_{new}-total_{true} = 0\\), then do nothing. If \\(total_{new}-total_{true} = total_{diff} &gt; 0\\), remove 1 from each of the top \\(n = total_{diff}\\) ranked ancestries. If \\(total_{new}-total_{true} = total_{diff} &lt; 0\\), add 1 to each of the top \\(n = total_{diff}\\) ranked ancestries. We keep ancestry variables where the proportion of the PUMA of that background equals or exceeds 1%. This means different ancestry variables were included for different PUMAs. The following table provides the list of included ancestries by PUMA. Table 4.1: PUMA01300 Ancestry Mappings PUMA 01300 Ancestries &gt;1% of Total Population American English French..except.Basque.

These data sample approximately 5% of individual responses to the ACS. Full documentation on this data is provided in the PUMS User Guide. We have downloaded the PUMS data at the highest spatial resolution available: PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area), geographic units developed in the Decennial Census (here, 2010) of approximately 100,000 people per PUMA. ## Rows: 8 Columns: 2 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (2): Variable, Explanation ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. ## Rows: 5 Columns: 2 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (2): Variable, Explanation ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Some mappings are more complex than others (like Ancestry and Hispanic/Latino(a) tables). All are made into factor variables with integers used to indicate categories. The following sections outline the mappings and factors created by constraint variable: Age (B01001) Age is a continuous variable in the PUMS dataset. We create age breaks at {0, 17, 24, 34, 44, 64, 200} and make a factor variable (1:6). Age is a categorical variable in the ACS dataset (as shown above). We use the following mapping to coerce the ACS data into 6 categories that will correspond to the PUMS breaks. Table 4.3: B01001 Mapping ACS Category Recategorization Corresponding PUMS Factor (continuous integer breaks) Under 5 years 1 &lt;18 5-9 years 1 &lt;18 10-14 years 1 &lt;18 15-17 years 1 &lt;18 18 and 19 years 2 18-24 20 years 2 18-24 21 years 2 18-24 22-24 years 2 18-24 25-29 years 3 25-34 30-34 years 3 25-34 35-39 years 4 35-44 40-44 years 4 35-44 45-49 years 5 45-64 50-54 years 5 45-64 55-59 years 5 45-64 60 and 61 years 5 45-64 62-64 years 5 45-64 65 and 66 years 6 65+ 67-69 years 6 65+ 70-74 years 6 65+ 75-79 years 6 65+ 80-84 years 6 65+ 85 years and over 6 65+ Sex (B01001) The sex variable mappings do not require complex mappings (Male (1) and Female(2)). Education (B15001) The education ACS tables do not include the population under 18 years of age. In order for CO_BU.exe to function properly, the person-variables in the estimates_constraints.txt input need to sum to the respective total populations in the census tract. We complete the population for the education section of variables by calculating the remaining under 18 population (using B01001) and include this as a column in the education categories.

Additionally, note the added category in the ACS column for B19037 Household Income Mapping. A column of all 0 values is included in the ACS inputs to the estimation_constraints.txt data file in order to provide mapping to the NAs included in the PUMS data.

An additional category is also created for PUMS NA values, and a column of all 0 values is included in the ACS inputs to the estimation_constraints.txt data file in order to provide mapping to the NAs included in the PUMS data. Additionally, note the added category in the ACS column for B25007 Household Tenure Mapping. A column of all 0 values is included in the ACS inputs to the estimation_constraints.txt data file in order to provide mapping to the NAs included in the PUMS data.

Step 1. Pulling ACS Data. Run the following code (only need to run 1x): [ACS] - 0 - Grab ACS Data.R Objectives: Pull all raw census data using census API calls Provide census API key. Pull all custom functions (custom-functions.R). Define the PUMAs with census tracts to be included in each. Run through each individual file that pulls data: [ACS] - 0 - i - Ancestry.R. This script uses a reweight function (process_puma) to get the totals to align with the totals for other categories. This script also uses a grab_top_i_percent function to collapse the number of categories to those contributing at least i% of the total population. [ACS] - 0 - i - Hispanic and Latino.R This script also uses a grab_top_i_percent function to collapse the number of categories to those contributing at least i% of the total population. [ACS] - 0 - ii - Sex and Age.R. [ACS] - 0 - iii - Education.R. [ACS] - 0 - iv - HHage and HHincome.R. [ACS] - 0 - v - HHage and Tenure.R. Step 2. Output Estimation Constraints and Area List. Run the following code (run 1x per PUMA, adjusting inputs for lines 16-18): [ACS] - 1 - combine all.R. Objectives: For a given PUMA and its corresponding tracts, pull ACS columns into a table (estimation_constraints) and list all tracts (Area_list). To do after running: Copy output from this script into CO_BU_MAC/Data. Copy printed output for calc_pearson.xlsx, and then take the resulting excel column and paste into the constraining_tables_info.txt file in CO_BU_MAC/Data. Go to MA census tract data/ancestry - hispanic B03001/ and copy the resulting hispanic mapping files into the script [PUMS] - 1 - i - Create Ancestry and Hispanic and Latino Mappings.R Go to MA census tract data/ancestry B04006/ and copy the resulting ancestry mapping files into the script [PUMS] - 1 - i - Create Ancestry and Hispanic and Latino Mappings.R Step 3. Create Mapped Person and Mapped House files using PUMS data. Run the following code: [PUMS] - 1 - Read in PUMS data.R (run 1x per PUMA, adjusting lines 39 and 40). Objectives: For a given PUMA, produce person and household inputs using the PUMA, subset to the variables corresponding to those provided in the ACS table constraints used. This code runs all four [PUMS] scripts, creating mappings with [PUMS] - 1 - i - Create Ancestry and Hispanic and Latino Mappings.R, grabbing person data in [PUMS] - 1 - ii - person data.R, household data in [PUMS] - 1 - iii - house data.R, and finally creating the output files in [PUMS] - 1 - iv - convert PUMS to CO.R To do after running: Copy the mapped_person, mapped_house, and house_serials text files from the ACRESr output folder into CO_BU_MAC/Data. 4.6 Bring into the CO model 4.6.1 Prepare Data: As described in the R Code, you should have the following files in CO_BU_MAC/Data, as listed in CO_filelist.txt (each with the PUMA indicated at the end of the file name, except for CO_random_seednumbers.txt as this does not need to change). ‘Data/mapped_house_PUMA.txt’ ‘Data/mapped_person_PUMA.txt’ ‘Data/estimation_constraints_PUMA.txt’ ‘Data/Area_list_PUMA.txt’ ‘Data/constraining_tables_info_PUMA.txt’ ‘Data/control_parameters_PUMA.txt’ Correct line 3 to reflect the name of the folders where you would like the output from CO_BU run to go (see within Estimates and Estimate_Fit). Suggested label: PUMA#. Correct lines 7 and 8 to reflect the number of constraint cells (line 7) (see calc_pearson.xlsx for this) and the number of constraint cells scaled by 10x (line 8). ‘Data/CO_random_seednumbers.txt’ 4.6.2 Run CO_BU.exe In the terminal, with the directory set to the co-bu-mac folder, run the following: The make file, make.sh using the code: cd Code sh make.sh Then, in order to run the executable (should see the executable has been created in the co-bu-mac folder): cd .. codesign -s - CO_BU Why codesign? See here for explanation. Run the executable: co-bu-mac % ./CO_BU 4.6.3 Phase 1: with replacement This we will do for basic demographics, the 14 characteristics as before 4.6.4 Phase 2: without replacement This we will do once we have the housing data Jon shared 4.7 Exporting from the CO model "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
