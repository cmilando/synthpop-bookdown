Race/Ethnicity: B04006 People Reporting Ancestry Collapsed by town/city: all ancestry groups with more than 1% of the population represented are retained, those with less than 1% are collapsed to ‘other’ B03001 Hispanic or Latino by Specific Origin Sex and Age: B01001 Sex by Age Education: B15001 Sex by educational attainment for the population 18 years and over Householder Age and Household Income: B19307 Age of householder by household income in the past 12 months (2021 inflation-adjusted dollars) Householder Age and Tenure: B25007 Tenure by Age of Householder 4.3 PUMS data ACS 5-year (2017-2021) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files for person data and for household data. These data sample approximately 5% of individual responses to the ACS. Full documentation on this data is provided in the PUMS User Guide. We have downloaded the PUMS data at the highest spatial resolution available: PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area), geographic units developed in the Decennial Census (here, 2010) of approximately 100,000 people per PUMA. ## Rows: 8 Columns: 2 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (2): Variable, Explanation ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. ## Rows: 4 Columns: 2 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (2): Variable, Explanation ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
