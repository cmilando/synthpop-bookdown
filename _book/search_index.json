Note that the geographic resolution used for these methods is the census tract level. Obtaining the datasets required: Creating lists of census tracts located in each of the 10 PUMAs using R Pulling ACS census tract data for each of the 10 PUMA sets of census tracts using R Pulling the Public Use Microdata Samples for each PUMA, including person and household variables The datasets are then cleaned: ACS dataset are cleaned and combined in R (with separate runs for each PUMA) PUMS data is cleaned and combined in R (with separate runs for each PUMA) N.B. (1) and (2) above generate output textfiles which can then be read into and implemented in the CO model, which is written in Fortran. Update a few additional tables: Constraining tables information textfile. This file is also an output file with parameters used to reflect different ancestry bins by PUMA (NOTE: FJBI still confused by this). Control parameters file with PUMA name, number of constraint cells for that PUMA, and row below (number of constraint cells x 10). Run with CO_BU, the executable created by compiling Fortran code. Read the resulting output from the CO work using R. 4.1 Geographic area There are 21 cities and towns included in the Mystic River Watershed area: Burlington Lexington Belmont Watertown Arlington Winchester Woburn Reading Stoneham Medford Somerville Cambridge Boston (East Boston, Charlestown) Everett Malden Melrose Wakefield Chelsea Revere Winthrop Wilmington 4.2 ACS constraint tables ACS 5-year (2021) detailed estimates tables for Massachusetts census tracts were obtained. Race/Ethnicity: B04006 People Reporting Ancestry Collapsed by town/city: all ancestry groups with more than 1% of the population represented are retained, those with less than 1% are collapsed to ‘other’ B03001 Hispanic or Latino by Specific Origin Sex and Age: B01001 Sex by Age Table 4.1: B01001 Variables Age Categories &lt;18 18-24 25-34 45-64 65+ Education: B15001 Sex by educational attainment for the population 18 years and over Table 4.2: B15001 Variables Education Categories Below 18 years old Less than 9th grade 9th to 12th grade no diploma High school graduate GED or alternative Some college no degree Associate degree Bachelor degree Graduate or professional degree Householder Age and Household Income: B19307 Age of householder by household income in the past 12 months (2021 inflation-adjusted dollars) Householder Age and Tenure: B25007 Tenure by Age of Householder 4.3 PUMS data ACS 5-year (2017-2021) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files for person data and for household data. These data sample approximately 5% of individual responses to the ACS. Full documentation on this data is provided in the PUMS User Guide. We have downloaded the PUMS data at the highest spatial resolution available: PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area), geographic units developed in the Decennial Census (here, 2010) of approximately 100,000 people per PUMA. ## Rows: 8 Columns: 2 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (2): Variable, Explanation ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message. ## Rows: 4 Columns: 2 ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot; ## chr (2): Variable, Explanation ## ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
