# Methods

Overview of this is as in the README file, roughly as follows:

## ACS constraint tables

## PUMS data

## Bring into the CO model

### Phase 1: with replacement

This we will do for basic demographics, the 13 characteristics as before

### Phase 2: without replacement

This we will do once we have the housing data Jon shared

## Exporting from the CO model

## bookdown boiler plate
Math can be added in body using usual syntax like this 

## math example

$p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

$$
SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
$$

You can also use math in footnotes like this^[where we mention $p = \frac{a}{b}$].

We will approximate standard error to 0.027[^longnote]
